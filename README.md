SketchAtlas top-down 2d game in Godot Engine. Done for the Video Game Design (VGD) class project in PWr. Finish the quests and fight the enemies in order to reach the exit. Playable at https://hachiretsu.itch.io/sketchdash 

The game is still buggy, so when you are stuck on the walls, for example, click on the `pause` button to reset the game. Your state will be saved, but the whole layout will be regenerated - which means the enemies as well.
